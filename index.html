		<h2>Real-time strategy (RTS)</h2>
		<div>
            <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games that doesn't 
			progress incrementally in turns,but allow all players to play simultaneously, 
			in "real time". By contrast, in turn-based strategy (TBS) games, players take 
			turns to play. The term "real-time strategy" was coined by Brett Sperry to market 
			Dune II in the early 1990s.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
            <p>In a real-time strategy game, each participant positions structures and maneuvers 
			multiple units under their indirect control to secure areas of the map and/or 
			destroy their opponents' assets. In a typical RTS game, it is possible to create 
			additional units and structures, generally limited by a requirement to expend 
			accumulated resources. These resources are in turn garnered by controlling special 
			points on the map and/or possessing certain types of units and structures devoted 
			to this purpose. More specifically, the typical game in the RTS genre features 
			resource-gathering, base-building, in-game technological development, and indirect 
			control of units.</p>

		<h2>First-person shooter (FPS)</h2>
		<div>
            <p>A first-person shooter (FPS) is a video game centered on gun fighting and other 
			weapon-based combat seen from a first-person perspective, with the player experiencing 
			the action directly through the eyes of the main character.This genre shares 
			multiple common traits with other shooter games, and in turn falls under the action 
			games category. Since the genre's inception, advanced 3D and pseudo-3D graphics have 
			proven fundamental to allow a reasonable level of immersion in the game world, and 
			this type of games helped pushing technology progressively further, challenging 
			hardware developers worldwide to introduce numerous innovations in the field of 
			graphics processing units. Multiplayer gaming has been an integral part of the 
			experience, and became even more prominent with the diffusion of internet connectivity 
			in recent years.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="hide">
			<p>The first-person shooter genre has been traced back to Wolfenstein 3D (1992) which 
			has been credited with creating the basic archetype upon which subsequent titles 
			were based. One such title, considered the progenitor of the genre's mainstream 
			acceptance and popularity, was Doom (1993), often cited as the most influential 
			game in this category; for years, the term "Doom clone" was used to designate this 
			type of games, due to Doom's enormous success.Another common name for the genre 
			in its early days was "corridor shooter", since processing limitations of that era's 
			computer hardware meant that most of the action had to take place in enclosed areas, 
			such as corridors and small rooms.</p>

		<h2>Role-playing game (RPG)</h2>
		<div>
            <p>A role-playing video game, commonly referred to as a role-playing game (RPG) 
			or computer role-playing game (CRPG), is a video game genre where the player 
			controls the actions of a character (or several party members) immersed in some 
			well-defined world, usually involving some form of character development by way 
			of recording statistics. Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop 
			role-playing games and use much of the same terminology, settings and game 
			mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed 
			story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, 
			as well as replay value and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity 
			for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from 
			simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="hide">
			<p>Role-playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting,
				which is divided into a number of quests. Players control one or several characters 
				by issuing commands, which are performed by the character at an effectiveness 
				determined by that character's numeric attributes. Often these attributes increase 
				each time a character gains a level, and a character's level goes up each time the 
				player accumulates a certain amount of experience. Role-playing video games also 
				typically attempt to offer more complex and dynamic character interaction than what 
				is found in other video game genres. This usually involves additional focus on the 
				artificial intelligence and scripted behavior of computer-controlled non-player 
				characters.</p>
